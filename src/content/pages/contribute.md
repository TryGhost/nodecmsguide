# Contribute

Everybody is welcome to contribute to nodecms.guide, just fork the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tryghost/nodecmsguide) and send a pull request. Each Content Management System is a markdown file in the `src/content/projects` directory.

We'll only accept pull requests adding new CMS' if they follow these rules:

- **Node.js application:** Built on top of Node.js in some shape or form
- **Stick to the format:** Fill out all the same fields as the other CMS's in source/projects.
- **Short description:** Keep all the details for the body text, keep the description for the overview page short and sweet.

There are lots of traditional CMS listing out there, but for this one we're focusing on solutions built with [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org).
