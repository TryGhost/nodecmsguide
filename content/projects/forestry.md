## Forestry.io

Forestry.io is a Git-backed CMS (content management system) for websites and web products built using [static site generators](https://forestry.io/docs/faqs/glossary/static-site-generators/). Forestry bridges the gap between developers and their teams, by making development fun and easy, while providing powerful content management for their teams.

## What is Forestry?

The main thing to understand is that Forestry – unlike other content management systems – is entirely backed by Git.

To put it simply, Forestry is an editor-friendly interface over Git. This means that developers and editors can now use the same workflow and tool set.

This also means that all of your content and code always belongs to you, and is not stored in a database in the cloud out of your reach.

## Advantages

Choosing to build a static site and use a Git-backed CMS comes with a multitude of advantages over the traditional Monolithic CMS:

### Speed, reliability, and security

Static sites don’t require a complicated server setup to allow for the dynamic rendering of pages. This means your sites download faster for visitors, can handle insane volumes of traffic, and have many fewer touch points that are vulnerable to hacking.

### Continuous Deployment

Unlike traditional content management systems, your codebase is your website. That means developers can work on changes to the website locally, and then push to Git and automatically have them deployed to production.

### Unified Workflow

Gone are the days of developers and editors having completely separate workflows. Developers and editors now work in sync with Git, providing unparalleled ability to deliver quickly and easily.
