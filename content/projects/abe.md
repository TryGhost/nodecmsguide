## Prose
- Abe let your HTML pure: Nothing is added to your templates. The Sitemap plugin helps you inform the search crawlers about your pages. Free the SEO !
- Just configure the deployment you need, choose between amazon S3, Surge, Github, or any (S)FTP reachable server, and you're good to go !
- Creating your user database and a custom validation workflow ? It's one json away. Give rights en permissions to your users in a blink! AbeCMS is using oAuth2 (of course)
- And as your needs are specific, you can use existing plugins from others or create your owns. Algolia, Asana, Google Maps, PM2... Yours... What else ?
