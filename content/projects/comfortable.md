## Comfortable

Comfortable is an API-first CMS that integrates with any platform and framework to build websites, apps, or for the Internet of Things. The API is easy, intuitive and fast to connect.

### Content Collections
Aggregate, filter and sort any content or data in collections. You can use them as endpoints and make it easy for editors to find and manage content.

### Powerful and easy query API
Simply ask for the data your application needs, join information, form structure and follow references. Query responses are cached in a global CDN.

### Content Tree
All of your content, e.g. collections or single documents can be organized in a content tree. That enables editors and marketers to find and manage content quick and easy.
