## Comfortable

Comfortable is a headless CMS that enables fast and easy content editing for websites and apps.

### Deliver content anywhere

Using an API for content enables you to integrate a CMS anywhere. And in several places at the same time. Manage everything in one place and serve it to your website, app, E-Mail campaign, or even the smart fridge.

### Use your favorite frameworks and tools

Comfortable works with any App-Framework, Static Site Generator or even plain templates. If you have your own custom CMS, you can use the API as content engine.

### Elegant Authoring

Manage products and lists, the contents of your website or app, write a personal blog, host and handle all your assets in one place. Comfortable lets you do all of that in a convenient and intuitive way.
