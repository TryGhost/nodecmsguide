## Prismic

Prismic is a Content Management System, a tool for editing online content. Also known as a headless CMS, an API CMS, a content platform, a disruptive content-as-a-service digital experience... basically we've built a tool that lets you choose your technology, framework, and language and then easily manage your content.

## Why we think Prismic is good for developers

### API to fetch content

Unlike a traditional CMS, an API-based approach is much simpler and more secure. This includes options for REST, GraphQL, and SDKs that help our users to make the most of Prismic.

### No maintenance or server setup

We offer a high-level SLAs, scalability, and a global CDN. We'll make sure that everything is running smoothly in the background so that you can focus on your projects.

### A growing ecosystem

Built by developers for developers - we actively engage with the community.
