## What is Storyblok

Storyblok provides the infrastructure to create and manage content utilizing our frontend app or management API. It is not coupled to one specific presentation layer, such as websites. Modern web frameworks are built out of components. Storyblok provides the right content structure to fill those components with data using a nestable data structure.

## How it works

Your developers can now focus on your project: websites, e-commerce, mobile apps, digital showrooms and even your next big thing.

- Define your Models: Define the schema of your content. This includes creating a content type, components and adding the right fields such as `text`, `date`, `image` or even [custom field types](https://www.storyblok.com/docs/Guides/Creating-a-field-type-plugin).

- Create your content: Once the required content types and components are ready, any user can add content by filling up your fields in [our editor](https://www.storyblok.com/docs/the-editor).

- Use your content: The content, once saved and published, can be loaded on your website, mobile app, or any other channel using our Content Delivery API. The same content can be reused for any platform.

## Key Concept

The key concepts behind Storyblok are inspired by the [BEM methodology](http://getbem.com/). One way this manifests itself is through the relationship between developer and editor.

Understanding the basic terminologies described on [our key concept page](https://www.storyblok.com/docs/the-key-concept) will make it easier for you to work with Storyblok.
