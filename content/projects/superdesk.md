## Superdesk: Your digital newsroom

Superdesk is a state-of-the-art digital newsroom system. It combines headless CMS functionality with powerful workflow features for an end-to-end news creation, production, curation and distribution platform.

### Create once, publish everywhere

Manage the production process from creation to distribution across all channels in a single headless content management platform.

### Own your workflows

Superdesk workflows are created and controlled by your editorial users, not imposed on them by the newsroom software.

### Newsroom automation

Save time and effort with flexible article templates that automate recurring tasks and routines in the digital newsroom.
