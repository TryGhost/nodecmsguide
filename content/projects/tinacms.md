## Tina Is Not A CMS

Tina is a **lightweight but powerful toolkit** for creating a content editing interface with JavaScript components. Tina surfaces superpowers for developers to create an intuitive UI for real-time content editing, built directly into their website.

## Get Started

To use Tina, you should have a good working knowledge of your JavaScript framework & JAMstack tools of choice.

To get a better idea of what Tina is all about, take a look at [how Tina works](https://tinacms.org/docs/getting-started/how-tina-works).

If you’re itching to see what Tina can do, head over to the [Gatsby Quickstart Guide](https://tinacms.org/docs/gatsby/quickstart) to get up and running fast.
