## Relax
Relax is a powerful new generation CMS on top of React and Node.js which aims for a better way of building websites.

It features a live page builder based on components and a smart and easy way of binding dynamic data to them.

Our goal with Relax is to update the world with a new standard, having as the basic premise that anyone should be able to create a website without having to code.
