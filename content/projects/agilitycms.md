### Architecture
Agility is a Headless CMS. Get started immediately and build your solution on your own terms.

- Agility has APIs for everything. Use the REST API or our sync SDK (or both) to interact with your content.
- Code it your way. We don't dictate how your content is presented. Use one of our starter templates to bootstrap development, or use your own.
- Want to build a server-rendered website, single-page-application, or statically generated websites? Yep, we support that too.
- Database?! What database? Agility hosts and completely abstracts away your database so you never have to worry about maintenance, backups, or connection strings ever again.

### Configuration
We believe in a content first approach. Configure your CMS instance to suit your needs. Not the other way around.

- Built-in page management allows you to intuitively build out your website tree.
- Set up fields, entries, and relationships to build your bespoke content schema.
- Set up one or many regions/locales for your content.
- Implement built-in content workflows or use webhooks and custom logic to create your own.
- Configurable rich authoring experience. Adjust the interface to the skillset of your team.
- Plan personalized content needs.
- Integrate with anything! With custom fields, webhooks and REST APIs, you have the tools to work with any third-party system.

### Development
You shouldn't have to re-invent the wheel for each of your projects. Finally, a Headless CMS that can take care of traditional features for you, but gets out the way when you need it.

- Take advantage of the built-in page management, routing, and rendering framework to kickstart your project or roll your own.
- Content preview is enabled out-of-the-box.
- URL Redirection management within the CMS.
- Create website forms and capture submissions without writing any code, and ability to use webhooks for complex integrations.
- Build your project your way, in whatever platform or programming language. No speed limits.
- Get support when you need it, whether it's by chat, our forum, or email. We are always here to help!

### DevOps
We don't dictate how or where to deploy your project. Agility CMS will fit perfectly into your DevOps.
You can host and deploy your projects anywhere.

- Compatible with any DevOps pipeline.
- Need to know when content has been updated? We have webhooks for that.
- Agility CMS works with static site generators and we are working towards providing native plugins for Gatsby, VuePress, Gridsome, and Jekyll.
