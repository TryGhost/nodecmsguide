## Power your apps and websites from Trello

**Troglio** turns any Trello board into a headless **CMS** : connect any site or app to manage its content from Trello cards.

Writers can write using **markdown**, **TOML** or the Custom Fields Power-up to author their content from anywhere, **even offline !**

Developers can use data as they please without being tied to a provider or a database.

This results in amazing collaborations between authors and developers offering literally no limits to what can be built.

### Easy for writers...

Write into Trello cards like if they were pages. Collaborate, use markdown, attach images, preview your work... publish!

### ...neat for developers
Not only you get authors' content, but we also ship extra helpers : slug, permalink, type of content, template...

## Get started

**IMPORTANT:** Troglio is an independent power-up and thus has to be installed manually as a custom power-up: **it is not available in the public listings of Trello**, [here is why](https://github.com/Troglio/troglio#user-content-why-troglio-is-not-available-directly-into-trello-).

To install Troglio and to see all its features, check our complete guide at [https://troglio.com/guide](https://troglio.com/guide).
