## Slicknode

The GraphQL CMS and backend that automates the grunt work while keeping you in control. For everyone that loves to ship better software in less time.

### Why Slicknode?

Traditional software is not equipped to satisfy the increasing demands in a highly competitive marketplace. Combining data from a vast array of data sources with custom functionality is expensive and takes a lot of time. Slicknode automates this process and gives you the flexibility you need.

- Reduce costs by letting Slicknode automate the grunt work so you can invest in what gives you the competitive advantage.
- Reduce time to market and create better software at unparalleled speed.
- Simplify workflows by having one central data HUB that can deliver data and content to any channel (Web, Mobile, IoT etc.)
