## Apostrophe
Apostrophe is 100% JavaScript, both in the browser and the server. The asynchronous nature of Node.js delivers a much faster site. Apostrophe uses MongoDB for a rich, intuitive document storage model, and is built on the trusted Express framework to add custom routes to any module. Create templates easily using Nunjucks, and LESS stylesheet compilation is built right in.
