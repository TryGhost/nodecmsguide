## Any JSON CMS
The main goal of Any JSON CMS is to provide freedom in creating complex or simple content structures depending on your needs.

Basic usage:
- Create a model. Model gives an answer: how does your content entry should look like?
- Create an entry. Entry is content itself based on corresponding model.
- Create an API Key. Any client requesting content from the API needs to provide an API Key.
- Fetch your entries as a JSON and use them in any app.
