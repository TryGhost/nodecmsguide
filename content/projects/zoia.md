## Zoia
The goal of Zoia is to make Web development faster and to provide the most essential functions to the developer:

- Authorization system (registration, password reset etc.)
- Captcha (using Imager which is purely written in Java)
- User management module
- Navigation menu module
- Pages management including CKEditor and built-in image browser

The system core is written in ES6 and is using modern JavaScript syntax, the client code can be optionally compiled by Babel.
