## Appernetic
Build faster and more secure websites. It is the bridge between the simplicity of static websites and user-friendliness of CMS (content management system) authoring interfaces.

### Content editor
With the PageDown editor you have a formatting toolbar and a preview. You will preferable use markdown for formatting, which is easier to use than HTML, but you can also write HTML and also JavaScript code.

### Visual tree view
Using the visual tree view you can navigate the filesystem where the content is located, create, view and delete files and folders.

### Image editing
In the PageDown editor you can add an url to an image, view and select already uploaded images and also crop and upload images to Cloudinary.

### Theme management
Select from over 110 themes in the theme manager view or clone themes from your GitHub account or fork someone else's repository.

### Responsive layout
Appernetic is built with Twitter Bootstrap and has a responsive design that works on desktop and in most mobile web browsers.

### Fast and secure
Static pages are delivered very quickly. With no database and no server side processing of scripts, there's nothing to hack.

### Configuration
The markdown front matter meta data together with the site-wide settings gives you a powerful combination to configure your free website.

### Organization
Appernetic is organized in three separate parts: Project, Preview and Public, to keep it clean and structured to work with and manage.

### Social collaboration
Git and GitHub is used for version control, cloning, publishing and syncing of your project. Bring projects to life and work together from anywhere.
